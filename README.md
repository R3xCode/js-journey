“We learn by practice.” — Aristotle

Journey with JS 🚀
A personal adventure through JavaScript — from fundamentals to modern concepts. This is where I’m keeping track of my learning in JavaScript. It’s not meant to be perfect — just a collection of code, small projects, and notes as I move step by step from basics to advanced stuff.

🌱Why this repo?
I wanted a place to dump everything I try out while learning. Sometimes it’ll be clean projects, other times just rough experiments. Either way, it shows how I’m growing with JS.

🧩What’s inside?
1) Core concepts (variables, functions, loops, etc.).
2) Small projects (calculator, todo app, games).
3) Experiments with modern features (ES6+, async/await, modules).
4) Notes that future-me can look back on and laugh at 😅.

📚Resources I keep going back to:
1) MDN Docs.
2) Hitesh Choudhary JavaScript Playlist.
3) AI Platforms.

✨Final note:
This repo is less about showing off and more about learning in public. If you stumble here, feel free to peek around — maybe you’ll find something useful, or maybe you’ll just see the messy but fun process of learning.
